# Juicebox Project Cards Frontend

A frontend for the [Juicebox Project Cards contract](https://github.com/nnnnicholas/juicebox-project-cards):

> Juicebox Project Cards are a fun way to keep track of the health of your favorite Juicebox projects, right inside your own wallet! Project Cards are ERC-1155 NFT editions. Each project card corresponds to a specific project on the Juicebox Protocol. Project Cards display the same metadata as the canonical Juicebox Project NFT. Project cards display up-to-date treasury statistics for the corresponding project. If project owners customize their project metadata, the project cards will automatically update accordingly.

## Installation

1. `pnpm i`
2. `pnpm dev`
